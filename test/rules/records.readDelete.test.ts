// test/rules/records.readDelete.test.ts

// firestore.rules — records/{recordId} — the `read` rule (any role holder can read;
// a stranger cannot) and the `delete` rule (sole owner, or sole admin when no owners exist,
// and no other subjects remain anchored). This must mirror
// RecordDeletionService.checkDeletionPermissions exactly — the client's UI pre-flight checks
// are only as good as the actual security boundary behind them.
